Motivated people can achieve anything they set their mind to. But how does one stay motivated, especially to travel, when you are busy working and living life while your family and friends disparage your ideas, you’re overwhelmed planning your trip, or maybe just burnt out from being on the road already?



Motivation is not an unlimited wellspring but a battery that has to be kept fully charged. While the idea of travel is always inspiring, sometimes life gets in the way and then suddenly, your eyes are no longer on the prize.



Sometimes travel can be frustrating.



I’ve had my share of ups and downs. My trip to Iceland has been years in the making. I always talk about it but it kept getting delayed because “stuff came up.” It wasn’t until I finally said “enough” and booked my ticket right there that the trip became a reality. Years ago, burnt out, I went to Cambodia to recharge my batteries. I stayed in one place and watched movies and read books. Alone. It was relaxing, and one day I woke up and said “I’m ready to go again.”



When you plan your trips, you don’t think about the long boring hours on a bus, the delays, the annoying airports, dealing with snorers in hostel dorms, fending off tours and scammers, and all the other things that will suck the energy and joy out of your experience.



Eventually, you need to stop and recharge your batteries. To is stay in one place, watch Netflix, and relax.



It’s important to find ways to stay motivated, and, so today I wanted to share my eight tips on how to stay motivated to travel – whether you are planning your trip or feeling a little burnt out on the road:



1. Hold yourself accountable

The best thing you can do to stay focused is to be held accountable. Being accountable to others will help make sure that you don’t fall off the wagon. They will help keep you focused on your goal, and the social pressure to stay on track will provide some extra motivation to follow through. Whether that is betting money, having someone check in on you, keeping track of goals, or having someone help you plan, just being held accountable will force you to stay focused, even on those days you don’t feel like it!



We have a great group of people on the community forums that can help cheer you on toward your goals. Or use an anticharity like Stickk, which will donate money to your most hated cause if you don’t follow through.



Accountability ensures action and can force you to follow through when a lack of energy would otherwise hold you back.
